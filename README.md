# Decision Making (Goal Oriented Action Planning algorithm)

The goal of this project is to implement an agent that is capable of attending to its different needs dynamically. This involves taking into account its internal needs (hunger, rest, pursuit of wealth, etc) and the current status of the environment around him. 
In the video below you can see that the agent knows to avoid opponent areas (marked with green flags), conquer resources for itself by planting its own red flags, hunt boars for food, create new arrows from trees, rest when tired and collect money in chests when possible.
